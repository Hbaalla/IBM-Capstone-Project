    "## In this report I would like to introduce the business problem which lied at the bases of my final capstone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The setting is as follows: you are a wealthy man in Toronto with the drive to start a business. But you are lacking in creativity. So how do you know what kind of business to start? You know one thing for sure, and that is: YOU ARE CRAZY ABOUT VENUES. Since you were a little kid you were always fascinated by all kinds of venues. Be them, libraries, mexican food restaurants, or a park where you would feed the ducks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### So you know what you gonna do with that bag of money you've saved up. You gonna start a venue for sure. But a smart man thinks ahead. What's the competition like in the venue branch here in Toronto? What kind of venue categories exist in Toronto, and what are the top venues based on number of individual venue? And in which borough and neighbourhood do you need to settle?\n",
    "\n",
    "### So many questions and there is no clarity. Lucky for you, there are people like data scientist who know exactly how to get rid of the fog in your head, so you could see a crystal clear picture of your future venue business.\" What you want to know is wat the most frequent venues are in the Toronto neighbourhoods. This can help you get inspiration to start your own venue business, as well as gaining an insight in the competition. And this can also help you decide in which neighbourhood to start."
